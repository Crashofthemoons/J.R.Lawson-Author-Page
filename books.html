    <h2>About Forget Me Not</h2>
    <p>When seventeen year old Zack Graves tragically (and somewhat comically) dies from a plumbing accident in his own home, he meets Melvin, his assigned reaper come to take him down to The Land of the Dead where he now has to adjust to his new life as a zombie. That is, until he goes “upstairs” on Halloween night and meets a girl by the name of Jane Godfree. There’s only one problem: he’s dead and she’s alive. Could there be some way for them to be together? Or could Jane really learn to love a zombie? It's the tale of a zombie and a love story from beyond the grave.</p>

    <h2>About Blood Land</h2>
    <p>Nora Wells is twenty-one years old, living with her long time best friend Will Davis, and considers herself, for the most part, an average girl. At least, average for the year 2024, a time where the vampire virus is alive and well and humans are forced to barricade their homes once the sun sets in defense against the vamps--and the terrifying demonic, gargoyle-like forms that they change into each night. Yet, despite the times she lives in, Nora feels differently toward the so called "monsters". So differently, in fact, that she ends up saving one from death--a vampire she comes to only know as Rogan, who, in turn, despite his obvious disdain for her and most humans, repays her debt by healing her one night when she is attacked. However, his act has seemed to cause more problems than it solved because now Nora is showing signs of vampiric tendencies. How could this be if she hasn't been bitten? Needless to say, she and Rogan will soon find out that this is the least of their worries and just the beginning of their adventures.</p>
