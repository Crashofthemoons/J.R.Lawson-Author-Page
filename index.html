            <p>
                A girl named Melinda Shaw goes through life being possessed by a demon she knows as Morfran. She has been possessed since she was six, and instead of trying to rid herself of the entity, she has since developed an almost friendship with him and uses his demon powers to right the wrongs around her town. That is, until she meets some new people along the way, finds some magic inside her that she didn’t even know she had, and even unravels a prophecy for the end of the world that she soon realizes having a demon inside her might be even more complicated than she had originally thought.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    It’s the year 2048, and vampires are now living peacefully amongst humans...almost. Twenty-three years after the destruction of Dagon’s reign, Kale and Nora Rogan are finding it difficult to juggle being leaders of their community with family life. Even though vampires and humans have been almost completely integrated everywhere, prejudice is still blemishing what could become a new and peaceful way of existence, and no one feels it more than the younger generation. Kale and Nora’s kids, Mina and Michael, just want to be normal teens, but when one of them is human, and the other a vampire, it can make understanding one another even harder. Not to mention, going to school, dating, and dealing with unfair vampire phobias brought on by a new radical group that's cropping up around the country. It seems as though this New Age is going to take some time. Can vampires and humans really learn to coexist, or is it, as some may think, against nature?

                <p>
                    When seventeen year old Zack Graves tragically (and somewhat comically) dies from a plumbing accident in his own home, he meets Melvin, his assigned reaper come to take him down to The Land of the Dead where he now has to adjust to his new life as a zombie. That is, until he goes “upstairs” on Halloween night and meets a girl by the name of Jane Godfree. There’s only one problem: he’s dead and she’s alive. Could there be some way for them to be together? Or could Jane really learn to love a zombie? It's the tale of a zombie and a love story from beyond the grave.

                <p>
                    Nora Wells is twenty-one years old, living with her long time best friend Will Davis, and considers herself, for the most part, an average girl. At least, average for the year 2024, a time where the vampire virus is alive and well and humans are forced to barricade their homes once the sun sets in defense against the vamps--and the terrifying demonic, gargoyle-like forms that they change into each night. Yet, despite the times she lives in, Nora feels differently toward the so called "monsters". So differently, in fact, that she ends up saving one from death--a vampire she comes to only know as Rogan, who, in turn, despite his obvious disdain for her and most humans, repays her debt by healing her one night when she is attacked. However, his act has seemed to cause more problems than it solved because now Nora is showing signs of vampiric tendencies. How could this be if she hasn't been bitten? Needless to say, she and Rogan will soon find out that this is the least of their worries and just the beginning of their adventures.

            <p>
                J.R. LAWSON is a self-published author of two novels so far for young adults. Among are, Forget Me Not—a lovable zombie romance, and Blood Land—a vampire adventure story. She says “As long as I’ve been enjoying making up stories (which is quite a long time) I’ve also enjoyed the spooky and supernatural.  I’ve always been a fan of the classic movie monsters and love re-imagining them in unique ways and putting them in different situations.  I have notebooks of ghost stories I used to write when I was in middle school that I go back to still from time to time.  I’ve always loved writing and imagining but I started my first book in high school and finished it during college.  I had written it solely for myself but I soon realized that others seemed to like my writing and story as well and I loved sharing it so the idea to self-publish began.  I started as only releasing it as an e-book but once I realized it was more popular than I had thought, the physical copy soon followed.  Ever since, my creativity had been boosted even further and I will continue to enjoy writing and sharing these stories with anyone who is willing to read them.” Ms. Lawson lives in Huntsville, Alabama and works with animals on a daily basis.  In addition she has her own online Etsy shop where she makes and sells Halloween crafts in her spare time when she isn’t writing.
